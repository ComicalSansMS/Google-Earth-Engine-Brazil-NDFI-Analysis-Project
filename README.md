# An short analysis of deforestation in the Mato Grosso Region from 2000 to 2023

### This code uses the Google Earth Engine JavaScript API and Google Earth Engine Code terminal to conduct a spectral mixture anaylsis and forest NDFI analysis, extraction, mask, change, and classification on a Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 composite images from the Mato Grosso region in central Brazil. For more information about the NDFI analysis and interpretation, see the attached [report](Final_Project_Report.pdf).
